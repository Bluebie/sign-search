<h1>Add Video</h1>
<p>
  If you'd like to add videos to Find Sign’s results, that’s great! Here are some basic requirements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can post your videos on Instagram, Youtube, or your own website</li>
  <li>You must be a fluent, experienced Auslan user, or you must be making the videos with guidance from fuent Auslan users who check you are doing it right</li>
  <li>If you add videos of new, made up signs, you need to consistently indicate which ones are new inventions, for example using a different #hashtag on those videos, for example: #homesign</li>
  <li>You must have a way people can contact you with feedback, if they feel your sign video needs more context or contains a mistake. For example you could make sure comments are enabled on Youtube or Instagram videos, or on a personal website you could include a feedback form or contact details.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you can do everything in that list, you should <a href="https://m.me/tiny.fluff.creature">contact Phoenix</a> and we can talk about the details.
