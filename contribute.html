      <h1>Contribute</h1>
      <p>I’d love help to make this website better! Here are some ways you can help!</p>
      <h1>Sign Demonstration Videos</h1>
      <p>If you know some signs that you can’t find in the search, you can record videos and include new signs! There
        are some important things:</p>
      <ul><li>A short video is good. Just show how the sign is performed.</li>
      <li>Try to record it with good light and good quality</li>
      <li>Remember it will not have any sound or subtitles when it’s in search results!</li>
      </ul><p>If you are an individual and just want to contribute a few signs, you can upload the video clips to
        Youtube and <a href="https://m.me/tiny.fluff.creature">send the links to Phoenix</a>.</p>
      <p>If you are a small community organisation, and you want to do a series of videos about a topic,
        <a href="https://m.me/tiny.fluff.creature">chat with Phoenix</a> to learn how to make a Youtube Playlist that
        is compatible, and you can add new videos yourself without needing any help, by just adding them to the playlist.</p>
      <p>If you are a large organisation, with a lot of videos, or a custom website, and you want them included, you can
        <a href="https://m.me/tiny.fluff.creature">talk to Phoenix</a> about creating a Spider that automatically includes
        videos from your own website.</p>
      <h1>Logo and Design</h1>
      <p>If you are an illustrator, maybe you would like to make a fancy logo for the website? We can have fun up there!</p>
      <h1>Software</h1>
      <p>If you'd like to see how Find Sign works, or contribute changes to the code it runs on, check out the
        <a href="https://github.com/Bluebie/sign-search">GitHub project</a>. If you'd like to locally mirror Find Sign or
        access our live search index data for your own projects, you can use Dat or Beaker Browser to grab a live synced
        copy of the site. Our Dat address is <a href="dat://find.auslan.fyi/">dat://find.auslan.fyi/</a> or you can check
        the current Dat address by visiting our <a href=".well-known/dat">.well-known/dat</a> file. If you just have
        unreliable internet or want a faster experience, Beaker Browser is a great way to subscribe to our Dat so you have
        an offline local copy available at all times that stays up to date. If you have trouble using Dat to sync the
        website, you can use a BitTorrent app with WebSeed support (most work these days) with our
        <a href="datasets.torrent">datasets.torrent</a> file.</p>
