      <h1>What is this?</h1>
      <p>This website is a search engine. It looks at other websites that have Auslan sign videos, and creates search results including videos from other websites. This search system uses Artificial Intelligence research to understand what words and signs mean, and find signs with similar meaning.</p>
      <p>Try any English word. This website will try to understand what the word means, and find sign videos with similar meaning. It's different to how other Auslan search systems work. You don’t need to type the same words the authors of sign videos used in their English descriptions. If the meaning is similar, it should work!</p>
      <h1>Who is this for?</h1>
      <p>I think it’s useful for two people:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Person learning Auslan: they can learn more vocabulary</li>
        <li>Person who doesn’t know alot of English: They can look up an English word, and see roughly what it might mean in Auslan, even if no sign for exactly that idea exists in the websites yet.</li>
      </ol>
      <h1>Who made it?</h1>
      <p>My name is Phoenix. I’m Hard of Hearing, and I love Auslan! English is my first language, but Auslan is my favourite language. I started learning about a year ago, and some of the tools are difficult for me to use, so I want to fix that for me and all my friends.</p>
      <p>I want to help spread Auslan to people who cannot learn it. Maybe they are too poor to come to Deaf socials or go to Tafe, or maybe they live far away and cannot travel. I think a lot of people can get better lives by learning some Auslan, and there are lots of ways to help spread information and grow our community! Even if they only learn vocabulary and use signed english, it can still help make their lives improve!</p>
